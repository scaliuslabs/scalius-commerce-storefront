## 🛠 Project Architecture

This is a **Storefront** application built with modern web technologies:

1.  **Framework:** Astro 5.0 (SSR + Static)
2.  **UI Library:** React 19
3.  **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
4.  **State Management:** Nanostores
5.  **Components:** shadcn/ui

It connects to the **Scalius Commerce Lite** backend for data and commerce logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** (We use pnpm for package management)
- **Scalius Commerce Lite Backend** (Local or Remote instance)

### Local Setup

1.  **Fork and Clone**
    Fork the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scalius-commerce-storefront.git
    cd scalius-commerce-storefront
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**
    Copy the example environment file or create a `.env` file. You need to point this to your backend:

    ```env
    PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4321/api/v1
    ```

4.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The storefront should be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port Astro assigns).

## 💻 Development Workflow

1.  **Create a Branch**
    Create a new branch for your feature or fix.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-cart-design
    # or
    git checkout -b fix/mobile-menu-bug
    ```

2.  **Make Changes**
    - **Components:** Build reusable UI components in `src/components`.
    - **Pages:** Add or modify routes in `src/pages`.
    - **Global Styles:** Edit `src/styles/global.css` for Tailwind configuration if needed.

3.  **Test Your Changes**
    - Ensure the UI looks good on both Desktop and Mobile.
    - Verify interactions with the backend (Add to cart, Checkout, etc.).

4.  **Commit**
    We encourage using **Conventional Commits** messages:
    - `feat: add sticky header`
    - `fix: resolve mobile overflow issue`
    - `style: improve product card typography`

5.  **Push and Open a PR**
    Push your branch to your fork and submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository.

## 📋 Coding Standards

- **TypeScript:** We use TypeScript for everything. Please do not use `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Formatting:** We use Prettier. Ensure your editor is configured to format on save, or run `pnpm format` (if available).
- **Tailwind:** Use utility classes for styling. Avoid writing custom CSS unless for complex animations.
